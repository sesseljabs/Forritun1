The
Trump
administration
is
expected
on
Wednesday
to
formally
revoke
California's
legal
authority
to
set
tailpipe
pollution
rules
that
are
stricter
than
federal
rules,
in
a
move
designed
by
the
White
House
to
strike
twin
blows
against
both
the
liberal-leaning
state
that
President
Trump
has
long
antagonized
and
the
environmental
legacy
of
President
Barack
Obama.
The
formal
revocation
of
California's
authority
to
set
its
own
rules
on
tailpipe
pollution
—
the
United
States'
largest
source
of
greenhouse
emissions
—
will
be
announced
Wednesday
afternoon
at
a
private
event
at
the
Washington
headquarters
of
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency,
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter.
